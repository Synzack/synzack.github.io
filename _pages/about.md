Hello friend. My name is Zach and welcome to my site. A little about me, I am currently a red team operator and security researcher at [ReliaQuest.](https://www.reliaquest.com/) I am fascinated with the magic that is offensive security and hope to share some of that in this site. My past experiences include incident respone, threat intelligence, and finance (weird right?). I currently hold OSCP and OSCE certifications. My current goals are researching new(ish) techniques to create guides and tools around them. 

That being said, I created this site as a way to share my ideas, research, tools, or anything else that I may find cool or useful. I hope you find something here you find interesting. Feel free to reach out anytime with questions or feedback! I'll be around.

-Zach
